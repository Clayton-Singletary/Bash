awk       *****compares patterens*****
awk'{print}' menu.txt <prints all lines like the cat command>
awk '/latte/ {print}' menu.txt <prints only lines with the pattern provided>
awk '{print $1,$4}' coffeeshop.txt <prints only the 1st and 4th objects in a line delimited by white space>
tail /etc/passwd |awk -F: '{print $NF}' <provides the last fields of the last ten of the etc/passwd file>
awk 'NR==3, NR==7 {print NR,$0}' coffeshop.txt <prints the line numbers provided ie 3-7>

sort      *****sorts shit*****
sort abc.txt <sorts alphanumerically>
sort -o numbsandletters.txt abc.txt <sorts and makes a newfile with the results> <// to append?>
sort -k 2 coffeeshop.txt <sorts by second field in this case>
sort -u coffeeshop.txt <removes duplicates>
sort -n numb.txt <sorts by numerical value>
sort -r numb.txt <sorts in reverse order>

sed       *****does not change file if you want changes to stay make a new file and redirect output*****
sed 's/tea/coffee/' beststuff.txt <replaces tea with coffee once per line>
sed 's/tea/coffee/g' beststuff.txt <replaces all occurences of tea with coffee in a .txt file>
sed 's/tea/coffee/2' beststuff.txt <replaces the second ocurence of tea in every line>
sed '5 s/crazy/coffee/' beststuff.txt <replaces first occurence of crazy in the 5th row>
sed '6,7 s/tea/coffee/g' beststuff.txt <replaces every occurence of tea in lines 6 and 7>

uniq  *****sort it first for better results <ie: sort | uniq>*****
uniq -c coffeshop.txt <counts the number of repeated lines for each line that gets repeated>
uniq -d coffeeshop.txt <shows duplicated lines>
uniq -D coffeshop.txt <shows all duplicates>
uniq -c -i coffeeshop.txt <-i makes this case insensitive>

conditionals
<student guide has list of conditionals>

scripts 
chmod +x <script>

aliases     *****temporary but can be made perm by placing in your profile*****
alias = <name>=<command>      <this makes an alias>
alias -p      <shows list of aliases>
unalias <name>      <removes alias of provided name>

command substitution        *****temp unless placed in profile*****
A=$(tail /etc/passwd) <sets a command to a variable for faster use in this case variable is $A>
echo $A <this uses the above variable>
